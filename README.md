This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## It relies on Strapi Headless CMS 
it uses two collection, for products, user authentication, and card with local storage which will be implemented. Im still trying to get to know better NextJS, i've tried to have a clear implementation and separation. For most cases im very sure this is adequate but feel free to ping for comments. 

 


# Thanks





npm run develop on strapi
